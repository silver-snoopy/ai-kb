### Task Statement 2.1: Design effective tool interfaces with clear descriptions and boundaries

Knowledge of:

- Tool descriptions as the primary mechanism LLMs use for tool selection; minimal descriptions lead to unreliable selection among similar tools
- The importance of including input formats, example queries, edge cases, and boundary explanations in tool descriptions
- How ambiguous or overlapping tool descriptions cause misrouting (e.g., analyze_content vs analyze_document with near-identical descriptions)
- The impact of system prompt wording on tool selection: keyword-sensitive instructions can create unintended tool associations

Skills in:

- Writing tool descriptions that clearly differentiate each tool's purpose, expected inputs, outputs, and when to use it versus similar alternatives
- Renaming tools and updating descriptions to eliminate functional overlap (e.g., renaming analyze_content to extract_web_results with a web-specific description)
- Splitting generic tools into purpose-specific tools with defined input/output contracts (e.g., splitting a generic analyze_document into extract_data_points, summarize_content, and verify_claim_against_source)
- Reviewing system prompts for keyword-sensitive instructions that might override well-written tool descriptions

### Task Statement 2.2: Implement structured error responses for MCP tools

Knowledge of:

- The MCP isError flag pattern for communicating tool failures back to the agent
- The distinction between transient errors (timeouts, service unavailability), validation errors (invalid input), business errors (policy violations), and permission errors
- Why uniform error responses (generic "Operation failed") prevent the agent from making appropriate recovery decisions
- The difference between retryable and non-retryable errors, and how returning structured metadata prevents wasted retry attempts

Skills in:

- Returning structured error metadata including errorCategory (transient/validation/permission), isRetryable boolean, and human-readable descriptions
- Including retriable: false flags and customer-friendly explanations for business rule violations so the agent can communicate appropriately
- Implementing local error recovery within subagents for transient failures, propagating to the coordinator only errors that cannot be resolved locally along with partial results and what was attempted
- Distinguishing between access failures (needing retry decisions) and valid empty results (representing successful queries with no matches)

### Task Statement 2.3: Distribute tools appropriately across agents and configure tool choice

Knowledge of:

- The principle that giving an agent access to too many tools (e.g., 18 instead of 4-5) degrades tool selection reliability by increasing decision complexity
- Why agents with tools outside their specialization tend to misuse them (e.g., a synthesis agent attempting web searches)
- Scoped tool access: giving agents only the tools needed for their role, with limited cross-role tools for specific high-frequency needs
- tool_choice configuration options: "auto", "any", and forced tool selection ({"type": "tool", "name": "..."})

Skills in:

- Restricting each subagent's tool set to those relevant to its role, preventing cross-specialization misuse
- Replacing generic tools with constrained alternatives (e.g., replacing fetch_url with load_document that validates document URLs)
- Providing scoped cross-role tools for high-frequency needs (e.g., a verify_fact tool for the synthesis agent) while routing complex cases through the coordinator
- Using tool_choice forced selection to ensure a specific tool is called first (e.g., forcing extract_metadata before enrichment tools), then processing subsequent steps in follow-up turns
- Setting tool_choice: "any" to guarantee the model calls a tool rather than returning conversational text

### Task Statement 2.4: Integrate MCP servers into Claude Code and agent workflows

Knowledge of:

- MCP server scoping: project-level (.mcp.json) for shared team tooling vs user-level (~/.claude.json) for personal/experimental servers
- Environment variable expansion in .mcp.json (e.g., ${GITHUB_TOKEN}) for credential management without committing secrets
- That tools from all configured MCP servers are discovered at connection time and available simultaneously to the agent
- MCP resources as a mechanism for exposing content catalogs (e.g., issue summaries, documentation hierarchies, database schemas) to reduce exploratory tool calls

Skills in:

- Configuring shared MCP servers in project-scoped .mcp.json with environment variable expansion for authentication tokens
- Configuring personal/experimental MCP servers in user-scoped ~/.claude.json
- Enhancing MCP tool descriptions to explain capabilities and outputs in detail, preventing the agent from preferring built-in tools (like Grep) over more capable MCP tools
- Choosing existing community MCP servers over custom implementations for standard integrations (e.g., Jira), reserving custom servers for team-specific workflows
- Exposing content catalogs as MCP resources to give agents visibility into available data without requiring exploratory tool calls

### Task Statement 2.5: Select and apply built-in tools (Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob) effectively

Knowledge of:

- Grep for content search (searching file contents for patterns like function names, error messages, or import statements)
- Glob for file path pattern matching (finding files by name or extension patterns)
- Read/Write for full file operations; Edit for targeted modifications using unique text matching
- When Edit fails due to non-unique text matches, using Read + Write as a fallback for reliable file modifications

Skills in:

- Selecting Grep for searching code content across a codebase (e.g., finding all callers of a function, locating error messages)
- Selecting Glob for finding files matching naming patterns (e.g., **/*.test.tsx)
- Using Read to load full file contents followed by Write when Edit cannot find unique anchor text
- Building codebase understanding incrementally: starting with Grep to find entry points, then using Read to follow imports and trace flows, rather than reading all files upfront
- Tracing function usage across wrapper modules by first identifying all exported names, then searching for each name across the codebase
